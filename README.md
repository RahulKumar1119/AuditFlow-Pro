# In one or two sentences, what's your big idea?

Our project is an AI-powered Pre-Auditor that automatically extracts, cross-references, and validates data across multiple loan documents, such as IDs, bank statements, and tax forms, to flag inconsistencies before they reach human underwriters. It transforms a manual, error-prone checklist into a real-time digital dashboard.

# Tell us about your vision. What exactly will you build?

We are building the Automated Loan Document Auditor, a serverless application that acts as a quality-control gate for lending teams. When a loan officer uploads a document package, the system performs four core functions. First, it extracts and classifies documents to identify if they are W2s, driver's licenses, or bank statements. Second, it validates the data by matching names, addresses, and income figures across all files to find discrepancies. Third, it generates alerts, including a Confidence Score and a Risk Report that highlights exactly where information does not match or where handwriting is illegible. Finally, it presents these insights through an Underwriter Dashboard, a clean interface built with React that organizes findings for immediate action.

# How will your solution make a difference?

Currently, bank employees spend hours manually comparing documents, which leads to fatigue and missed errors. Our solution provides three major benefits. For Employees, it reduces manual data entry by 80 percent, allowing them to focus on high-value risk assessment rather than clerical work. For the Bank, it drastically lowers the risk of compliance fines and fraudulent applications by ensuring 100 percent of documents are audited, not just a sample. For Customers, it speeds up loan approval times from days to hours by removing the administrative bottleneck.

# What's your game plan for building this?

We will use Kiro's Spec-Driven Development to move from idea to deployment through five key stages. First, we will define requirements by using Kiro to generate a document that defines the Golden Record matching logic. Second, we will design a serverless architectural flow using Amazon S3 for storage, Lambda for triggers, Textract for extraction, Bedrock for analysis, and DynamoDB for results. Third, we will handle core feature implementation by using Kiro's agentic chat to scaffold the functions required for multi-page PDF processing. Fourth, we will focus on security integration by prompting Kiro to write IAM policies and encryption settings to ensure banking data is handled securely at-rest and in-transit. Finally, we will manage iteration by using Kiro Agent Hooks to automatically run unit tests every time we update the document extraction logic.

# Which AWS AI services will power your solution?

# What other AWS Free Tier Services will you employ?

# Model


**1. Presentation & Identity Layer**
   
**Loan Officer (React Dashboard)**: This is a custom-built web interface that allows users to manage the "Audit Queue." It allows for drag-and-drop document uploads and displays the final "Risk Reports" generated by the AI.

**AWS Amplify**: This service automates the deployment and hosting of your React frontend. It also provides the "Amplify Libraries" that allow your frontend to communicate securely with your backend S3 and DynamoDB.

**Amazon Cognito**: In banking, you cannot have open access. Cognito manages user sign-up and sign-in, ensuring that only authorized loan officers can view sensitive financial documents.

**2. Ingestion & Storage Layer**

**Amazon S3 (The Landing Zone)**: Think of this as the "Digital Inbox." When a file is uploaded, it is stored in an encrypted S3 bucket.

**Event Trigger**: S3 is configured with "Event Notifications". The moment a PDF lands in the bucket, it sends a signal to start the audit process immediately, ensuring zero idle time.

**3. The Orchestration Layer**

**AWS Lambda (The Orchestrator):** This is the "Traffic Controller". It doesn't do the heavy lifting itself; instead, it triggers other services in the correct order. For example, it tells Textract to start reading, waits for the result, and then passes that text to Bedrock for analysis.

**AWS Step Functions (Advanced)**(_Optional)_: For a professional competition entry, you should use Step Functions to manage the workflow. It handles "retries" if a service is busy and ensures that if the PII detection fails, the document is blocked from moving forward.

**4. The AI Analysis Layer (The Specialized Tools)**

**Amazon Textract**: Unlike standard OCR, Textract understands "forms" and "tables". It can identify that a specific number on a page is "Gross Monthly Income" and extract it into a digital format that the AI can understand.

**Amazon Bedrock (The Auditor)**: This uses Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude or Llama to perform "Reasoning". You give it a prompt: "Compare the income on this W2 with the deposits in this bank statement. Are there any discrepancies?"

**Amazon Comprehend**: This is your "Compliance Officer". It scans the text to find PII like Social Security Numbers or personal phone numbers and can automatically redact them so the final report is safe to share.

**5. Storage & Monitoring Layer**
**Amazon DynamoDB**: This is your "Audit Results Database". It stores the final outcome: a JSON object containing the Loan ID, the Risk Score (0-100), and a list of identified red flags. It is optimized for high-speed retrieval by the dashboard.

**AWS KMS & CloudWatch**_(Optional)_: KMS manages the encryption keys for your documents, while CloudWatch records every action for a perfect audit trail, which is a key requirement for banking workplace efficiency.




**_Here is the detailed technical breakdown of how we will create the application components:_**


**1. Presentation & Identity Layer (The Interface)**
   
**React Dashboard:** This is the primary portal for the Loan Officer. It is built using React.js to handle asynchronous state management, which is necessary when waiting for AI analysis results.

**AWS Amplify:** You will use Amplify to host the frontend. It provides the "Amplify Auth" library to connect directly to Amazon Cognito, ensuring that only authorized banking personnel can access sensitive financial data.

**Amazon Cognito:** This service manages User Pools and Identity Pools. It issues JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that the frontend must send to the backend to prove the user's identity before any document is processed.

**2. Ingestion & Storage Layer (The Landing Zone)**

**Amazon S3:** You will create an S3 bucket configured for "Private" access. When a file is uploaded via the React dashboard, it is stored in the Raw Zone.

**S3 Event Notifications:** We will configure the bucket to send a notification to AWS Lambda the instant a .pdf or .jpg file is successfully uploaded.

**3. The Orchestration Layer (The Logic Controller)**

**AWS Lambda (The Orchestrator):** This function acts as the "Traffic Controller." It does not perform the audit itself but coordinates the API calls to Textract and Bedrock in the correct sequence.

**AWS Step Functions:** For a professional entry, we will use Step Functions to create a "State Machine." This allows the application to handle errors (like a blurry photo) and retries automatically without crashing.

**4. AI Analysis Layer (The Intelligence)**

**Amazon Textract:** The Orchestrator sends the S3 object to Textract's AnalyzeDocument API. Textract extracts Key-Value pairs (e.g., "Salary: $5000") and Tables (e.g., monthly bank transactions).

**Amazon Bedrock:** We will feed the extracted text from Textract into an LLM (like Claude) on Bedrock. Using Prompt Engineering, we will ask the model to "Reason" through the data to find mismatches between documents.

**Amazon Comprehend:** This service runs as a parallel step to detect PII (Personally Identifiable Information). It identifies sensitive numbers like Social Security IDs and can redact them before the report is saved.

**5. Storage & Monitoring Layer (The Output)**

**Amazon DynamoDB:** Once the audit is complete, the results—including a Risk Score, a list of Flagged Inconsistencies, and metadata—are saved in a DynamoDB table.

**AWS KMS:** All documents in S3 and all data in DynamoDB are encrypted using keys managed by the Key Management Service, meeting banking-grade security standards.

**Amazon CloudWatch:** Every action taken by the AI is logged here. This creates a "Paper Trail," which is essential for workplace efficiency and regulatory audits in banking.
